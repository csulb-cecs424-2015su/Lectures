# Python allows functions to be nested in other functions.

    # When a nested function is executed, its referencing environment
    # is created with references assigned to all values in the scope of the
    # outer function. When we call fun2, it will have bindings that reference
    # the values of local1, local2, and param1. If those are mutable values,
    # changes made in fun2 to their values will also affect fun1's scope.
